This page was actually created on 12/23, but the page name is 12/22 because the story happened yesterday. I am curious if, once the page is published, the blog will show the actual date or the date in the file name.

My son wanted to visit the Pokémon store in the next town to buy some Pokémon cards. He hadn't been there for a while, and we thought it was reasonable to get him some new cards before Christmas. Originally, he was just looking for cheaper packs priced under 10 dollars. My wife suggested he could buy a more expensive one but less often. In the end, we bought a pack for 30 dollars. 
On our way home, my son opened the pack and was thrilled to find a card of [Pikachu](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/590027/pokemon-sv08-surging-sparks-pikachu-ex-238-191?page=1&Language=English). He said it is very rare and potentially valuable. He always claimed his cards could sell for a high price, but we never believed him. My son wanted to return to the store to verify if it was indeed a rare card. The store manager searched the trading platform [TCGPlayer](https://www.tcgplayer.com) and confirmed that there had been two transactions of this card for almost 500 dollars yesterday. He also mentioned it was the biggest hit in the past year and a half at his store.
