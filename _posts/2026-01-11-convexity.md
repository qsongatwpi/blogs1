We will prove that the midpoint convexity implies the full convexity under mild conditions. 
Then, what is midpoint convexity? We say $f:(0,1) \mapsto \mathbb R$ is $\lambda$-convex if 
$$
f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \le \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y), \quad
\forall x, y \le (0,1).
$$

To be completed ...
